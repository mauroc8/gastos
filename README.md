👷‍♀️ Under construction

# Start

- Install gleam
- Install rebar3
- I copied the contents of lustre's v4 `src/` directory into `common/src/` because I needed some bugfixes. This should be temporary
  until lustre v5.

To build the frontend (temporarily built on every server request to speed up development)

```
cd client
./build.sh
```

To run the backend

```
cd server
gleam run
```
